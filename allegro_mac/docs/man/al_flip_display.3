al_flip_display - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

void al_flip_display(void)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Copies or updates the front and back buffers so that what has been drawn
previously on the currently selected display becomes visible on screen.
Pointers to the special back buffer bitmap remain valid and retain their
semantics as the back buffer, although the contents may have changed.
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] If not using the ALLEGRO_SINGLE_BUFFER option, you
typically want to redraw every pixel of the backbuffer bitmap to avoid
uninitialized memory artifacts.

Several display options change how this function behaves:
.IP \[bu] 2
With ALLEGRO_SINGLE_BUFFER, no flipping is done.
You still have to call this function to display graphics, depending on
how the used graphics system works.
.IP \[bu] 2
The ALLEGRO_SWAP_METHOD option may have additional information about
what kind of operation is used internally to flip the front and back
buffers.
.IP \[bu] 2
If ALLEGRO_VSYNC is 1, this function will force waiting for vsync.
If ALLEGRO_VSYNC is 2, this function will not wait for vsync.
With many drivers the vsync behavior is controlled by the user and not
the application, and ALLEGRO_VSYNC will not be set; in this case
al_flip_display(3) will wait for vsync depending on the settings set in
the system\[cq]s graphics preferences.
