.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Destroys the given bitmap, freeing all resources used by it.
This function does nothing if the bitmap argument is NULL.
.PP
As a convenience, if the calling thread is currently targeting the
bitmap then the bitmap will be untargeted first.
The new target bitmap is unspecified.
(since: 5.0.10, 5.1.6)
.PP
Otherwise, it is an error to destroy a bitmap while it (or a sub-bitmap)
is the target bitmap of any thread.
