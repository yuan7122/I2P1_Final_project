#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

void al_draw_scaled_rotated_bitmap(ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bitmap,
   float cx, float cy, float dx, float dy, float xscale, float yscale,
   float angle, int flags)
\f[R]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Like al_draw_rotated_bitmap(3), but can also scale the bitmap.
.PP
The point at cx/cy in the bitmap will be drawn at dx/dy and the bitmap
is rotated and scaled around this point.
.IP \[bu] 2
cx - center x
.IP \[bu] 2
cy - center y
.IP \[bu] 2
dx - destination x
.IP \[bu] 2
dy - destination y
.IP \[bu] 2
xscale - how much to scale on the x-axis (e.g.\ 2 for twice the size)
.IP \[bu] 2
yscale - how much to scale on the y-axis
.IP \[bu] 2
angle - angle by which to rotate (radians)
.IP \[bu] 2
flags - same as for al_draw_bitmap(3)
