.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reads a 16-bit word in big-endian format (MSB first).
.PP
On success, returns the 16-bit word.
On failure, returns EOF (-1).
Since -1 is also a valid return value, use al_feof(3) to check if the
end of the file was reached prematurely, or al_ferror(3) to check if an
error occurred.
