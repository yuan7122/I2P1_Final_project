.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Get a handle for a joystick on the system.
The number may be from 0 to al_get_num_joysticks(3)-1.
If successful a pointer to a joystick object is returned, which
represents a physical device.
Otherwise NULL is returned.
.PP
The handle and the index are only incidentally linked.
After al_reconfigure_joysticks(3) is called, al_get_joystick(3) may
return handles in a different order, and handles which represent
disconnected devices will not be returned.
