ALLEGRO_BITMAP *al_create_sub_bitmap(ALLEGRO_BITMAP *parent,
   int x, int y, int w, int h)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a sub-bitmap of the parent, at the specified coordinates and of
the specified size.
A sub-bitmap is a bitmap that shares drawing memory with a pre-existing
(parent) bitmap, but possibly with a different size and clipping
settings.
.PP
The sub-bitmap may originate off or extend past the parent bitmap.
.PP
See the discussion in al_get_backbuffer(3) about using sub-bitmaps of
the backbuffer.
.PP
The parent bitmap\[cq]s clipping rectangles are ignored.
.PP
If a sub-bitmap was not or cannot be created then NULL is returned.
.PP
When you are done with using the sub-bitmap you must call
al_destroy_bitmap(3) on it to free any resources allocated for it.
.PP
Note that destroying parents of sub-bitmaps will not destroy the
sub-bitmaps; instead the sub-bitmaps become invalid and should no longer
be used for drawing - they still must be destroyed with
al_destroy_bitmap(3) however.
It does not matter whether you destroy a sub-bitmap before or after its
parent otherwise.
