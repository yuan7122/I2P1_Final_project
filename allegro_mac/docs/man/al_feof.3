.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

bool al_feof(ALLEGRO_FILE *f)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns true if the end-of-file indicator has been set on the file,
i.e.\ we have attempted to read \f[I]past\f[R] the end of the file.
.PP
This does \f[I]not\f[R] return true if we simply are at the end of the
file.
The following code correctly reads two bytes, even when the file
contains exactly two bytes:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
int b1 = al_fgetc(f);
int b2 = al_fgetc(f);
if (al_feof(f)) {
   /* At least one byte was unsuccessfully read. */
   report_error();
}
\f[R]
