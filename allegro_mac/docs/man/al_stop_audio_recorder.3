Stop capturing audio data.
Note that the audio recorder is still active and consuming resources, so
if you are finished recording you should destroy it with
al_destroy_audio_recorder(3).
.PP
You may still receive a few events after you call this function as the
device flushes the buffer.

If you restart the recorder, it will begin recording at the beginning of
the next fragment buffer.
