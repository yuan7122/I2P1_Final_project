ALLEGRO_SAMPLE(3).

file name extension including the leading dot.
.PP
Note that this stores the entire file in memory at once, which may be
time consuming.
To read the file as it is needed, use al_load_audio_stream_f(3).
.PP
Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.
The file remains open afterwards.
