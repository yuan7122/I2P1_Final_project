ALLEGRO_VOICE *al_create_voice(unsigned int freq,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a voice structure and allocates a voice from the digital sound
driver.
The passed frequency (in Hz), sample format and channel configuration
are used as a hint to what kind of data will be sent to the voice.
However, the underlying sound driver is free to use non-matching values.
For example, it may be the native format of the sound hardware.
.PP
If a mixer is attached to the voice, the mixer will handle the
conversion of all its input streams to the voice format and care does
not have to be taken for this.
However if you access the voice directly, make sure to not rely on the
parameters passed to this function, but instead query the returned voice
for the actual settings.
