al_init - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

#define al_init()    (al_install_system(ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT, atexit))
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Like al_install_system(3), but automatically passes in the version and
uses the atexit function visible in the current binary.
.RS
.PP
Note: It is typically wrong to call al_init anywhere except the final
game binary.
In particular, do not call it inside a shared library unless you know
what you\[cq]re doing.
In those cases, it is better to call al_install_system either with a
\f[C]NULL\f[R] atexit_ptr, or with a pointer to atexit provided by the
user of this shared library.
