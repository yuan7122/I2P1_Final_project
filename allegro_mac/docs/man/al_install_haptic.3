al_install_haptic - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

bool al_install_haptic(void)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Installs the haptic (force feedback) device subsystem.
This must be called before using any other haptic-related functions.
Returns true if the haptics subsystem could be initialized correctly,
false in case of error.
.PP
For portability you should first open a display before calling
al_install_haptic(3).
On some platforms, such as DirectInput under Windows,
al_install_haptic(3) will only work if at least one active display is
available.
This display must stay available until al_uninstall_haptic(3) is called.
.PP
If you need to close and reopen your active display for example, then
you should call al_uninstall_haptic(3) before closing the display, and
al_install_haptic(3) after opening it again.
.SH SINCE

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[R] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
