al_get_haptic_gain - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

double al_get_haptic_gain(ALLEGRO_HAPTIC *hap)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the current gain of the device.
Gain is much like volume for sound, it is as if every effect\[cq]s
intensity is multiplied by it.
Gain is a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Only works correctly if al_get_haptic_capabilities(3) returns a value
that has ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_GAIN(3)ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_CONSTANTS(3) set.
If this is not set, this function will simply return 1.0 and all effects
will be played without any gain influence.

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[R] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
