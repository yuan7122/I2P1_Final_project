.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Clear the error indicator for the given file.
.PP
The standard I/O backend also clears the end-of-file indicator, and
other backends \f[I]should\f[R] try to do this.
However, they may not if it would require too much effort
(e.g.\ PhysicsFS backend), so your code should not rely on it if you
need your code to be portable to other backends.
