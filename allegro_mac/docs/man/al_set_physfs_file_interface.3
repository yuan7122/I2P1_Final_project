al_set_physfs_file_interface - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro_physfs.h>

void al_set_physfs_file_interface(void)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function sets \f[I]both\f[R] the ALLEGRO_FILE_INTERFACE(3) and
ALLEGRO_FS_INTERFACE(3) for the calling thread.
.PP
Subsequent calls to al_fopen(3) on the calling thread will be handled by
PHYSFS_open().
Operations on the files returned by al_fopen(3) will then be performed
through PhysicsFS.
Calls to the Allegro filesystem functions, such as al_read_directory(3)
or al_create_fs_entry(3), on the calling thread will be diverted to
PhysicsFS.
.PP
To remember and restore another file I/O backend, you can use
al_store_state(3)/al_restore_state(3).
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] due to an oversight, this function differs from
al_set_new_file_interface(3) and al_set_standard_file_interface(3) which
only alter the current ALLEGRO_FILE_INTERFACE(3).

.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] PhysFS does not support the text-mode reading and
writing, which means that Windows-style newlines will not be preserved.
