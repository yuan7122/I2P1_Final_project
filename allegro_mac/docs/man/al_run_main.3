al_run_main - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP

\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

int al_run_main(int argc, char **argv, int (*user_main)(int, char **))
\f[R]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is useful in cases where you don\[cq]t have a main()
function but want to run Allegro (mostly useful in a wrapper library).
Under Windows and Linux this is no problem because you simply can call
al_install_system(3).
But some other system (like OSX) don\[cq]t allow calling
al_install_system(3) in the main thread.
al_run_main will know what to do in that case.
.PP
The passed argc and argv will simply be passed on to user_main and the
return value of user_main will be returned.
