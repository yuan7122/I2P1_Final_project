.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>

void al_calculate_ribbon(float* dest, int dest_stride, const float *points,
   int points_stride, float thickness, int num_segments)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Calculates a ribbon given an array of points.
The ribbon will go through all of the passed points.
If \f[C]thickness <= 0\f[R], then \f[C]num_segments\f[R] of points are
required in the destination buffer, otherwise twice as many are needed.
The destination and the points buffer should consist of regularly spaced
doublets of floats, corresponding to x and y coordinates of the
vertices.
