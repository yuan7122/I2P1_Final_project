.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a new native file dialog.
You should only have one such dialog opened at a time.
.PP
Parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]initial_path\f[R]: The initial search path and filename.
Can be NULL.
To start with a blank file name the string should end with a directory
separator (this should be the common case).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]title\f[R]: Title of the dialog.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]patterns\f[R]: A list of semi-colon separated patterns to match.
This should not contain any whitespace characters.
If a pattern contains the `/' character, then it is treated as a MIME
type (e.g.
`image/png').
Not all platforms support file patterns.
If the native dialog does not provide support, this parameter is
ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]mode\f[R]: 0, or a combination of the following flags:
.TP
ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FILE_MUST_EXIST
If supported by the native dialog, it will not allow entering new names,
but just allow existing files to be selected.
Else it is ignored.
.TP
ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SAVE
If the native dialog system has a different dialog for saving (for
example one which allows creating new directories), it is used.
Else it is ignored.
.TP
ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_FOLDER
If there is support for a separate dialog to select a folder instead of
a file, it will be used.
.TP
ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_PICTURES
If a different dialog is available for selecting pictures, it is used.
Else it is ignored.
.TP
ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_SHOW_HIDDEN
If the platform supports it, also hidden files will be shown.
.TP
ALLEGRO_FILECHOOSER_MULTIPLE
If supported, allow selecting multiple files.
.PP
Returns:
.PP
A handle to the dialog which you can pass to
al_show_native_file_dialog(3) to display it, and from which you then can
query the results using al_get_native_file_dialog_count(3) and
al_get_native_file_dialog_path(3).
When you are done, call al_destroy_native_file_dialog(3) on it.
.PP
If a dialog window could not be created then this function returns NULL.
