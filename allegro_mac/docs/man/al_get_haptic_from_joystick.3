If the joystick has haptic capabilities, returns the associated haptic
device handle.
Otherwise returns NULL.
It\[cq]s necessary to call this again every time the joystick
configuration changes, such as through hot plugging.
In that case, the old haptic device must be released using
al_release_haptic(3).
