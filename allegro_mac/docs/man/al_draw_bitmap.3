.SH SYNOPSIS

void al_draw_bitmap(ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bitmap, float dx, float dy, int flags)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Draws an unscaled, unrotated bitmap at the given position to the current
target bitmap (see al_set_target_bitmap(3)).
.PP
\f[C]flags\f[R] can be a combination of:
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_FLIP_HORIZONTAL - flip the bitmap about the y-axis
.IP \[bu] 2
ALLEGRO_FLIP_VERTICAL - flip the bitmap about the x-axis
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] The current target bitmap must be a different bitmap.
Drawing a bitmap to itself (or to a sub-bitmap of itself) or drawing a
sub-bitmap to its parent (or another sub-bitmap of its parent) are not
currently supported.
To copy part of a bitmap into the same bitmap simply use a temporary
bitmap instead.

\f[I]Note:\f[R] The backbuffer (or a sub-bitmap thereof) can not be
transformed, blended or tinted.
If you need to draw the backbuffer draw it to a temporary bitmap first
with no active transformation (except translation).
Blending and tinting settings/parameters will be ignored.
This does not apply when drawing into a memory bitmap.
