.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>

ALLEGRO_VERTEX_BUFFER* al_create_vertex_buffer(ALLEGRO_VERTEX_DECL* decl,
   const void* initial_data, int num_vertices, int flags)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates a vertex buffer.
Can return NULL if the buffer could not be created (e.g.\ the system
only supports write-only buffers).
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R]
.PP
This is an advanced feature, often unsupported on lower-end video cards.
Be extra mindful of this function failing and make arrangements for
fallback drawing functionality or a nice error message for users with
such lower-end cards.

\f[I]Parameters:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
decl - Vertex type that this buffer will hold.
NULL implies that this buffer will hold ALLEGRO_VERTEX(3) vertices
.IP \[bu] 2
initial_data - Memory buffer to copy from to initialize the vertex
buffer.
Can be \f[C]NULL\f[R], in which case the buffer is uninitialized.
.IP \[bu] 2
num_vertices - Number of vertices the buffer will hold
.IP \[bu] 2
flags - A combination of the ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_FLAGS(3) flags
specifying how this buffer will be created.
Passing 0 is the same as passing \f[C]ALLEGRO_PRIM_BUFFER_STATIC\f[R].
