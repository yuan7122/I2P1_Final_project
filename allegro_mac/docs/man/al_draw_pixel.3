al_draw_pixel - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

void al_draw_pixel(float x, float y, ALLEGRO_COLOR color)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Draws a single pixel at x, y.
This function, unlike al_put_pixel(3), does blending and, unlike
al_put_blended_pixel(3), respects the transformations (that is, the
pixel\[cq]s position is transformed, but its size is unaffected - it
remains a pixel).
This function can be slow if called often; if you need to draw a lot of
pixels consider using al_draw_prim(3) with ALLEGRO_PRIM_POINT_LIST from
the primitives addon.

x - destination x

\f[I]Note:\f[R] This function may not draw exactly where you expect it
to.
See the pixel-precise output section on the primitives addon
documentation for details on how to control exactly where the pixel is
drawn.
