.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Enumerates the types of storage an attribute of a custom vertex may be
stored in.
Many of these can only be used for ALLEGRO_PRIM_USER_ATTR attributes and
can only be accessed via shaders.
Usually no matter what the storage is specified the attribute gets
converted to single precision floating point when the shader is run.
Despite that, it may be advantageous to use more dense storage formats
(e.g.\ ALLEGRO_PRIM_NORMALIZED_UBYTE_4 instead of ALLEGRO_PRIM_FLOAT_4)
when bandwidth (amount of memory sent to the GPU) is an issue but
precision is not.
