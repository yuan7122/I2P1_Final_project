al_set_new_bitmap_samples - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

void al_set_new_bitmap_samples(int samples)
SETTER(new_bitmap_samples, samples)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sets the multi-sampling samples used by newly created bitmaps (on the
current thread) if they are used with al_set_target_bitmap(3).
0 means multi-sampling will not be used when drawing into the bitmap,
which is the default.
1 means multi-sampling will be used but only using a single sample per
pixel (so usually there will be no visual difference to not using
multi-sampling at all).
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] Some platforms have restrictions on when the
multi-sampling buffer for a bitmap is realized, i.e.\ down-scaled back
to the actual bitmap dimensions.
This may only happen after a call to al_set_target_bitmap(3).
So for example:
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
al_set_target_bitmap(multisample);
al_clear_to_color(blue);
al_draw_line(0, 0, 100, 100, red, 1);
al_lock_bitmap(multisample, ...)
// ERROR: the contents of the bitmap will be undefined

al_set_target_bitmap(backbuffer);
al_lock_bitmap(multisample, ...)
// CORRECT: at this point, the bitmap contents are updated and
// there will be an anti-aliased line in it.

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[R] This is an experimental feature and currently
only works for the OpenGL backend.
