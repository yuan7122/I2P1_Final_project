al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>

void al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes(const float *vertices,
   const int *vertex_counts, ALLEGRO_COLOR color)
\f[R]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Draws a filled simple polygon with zero or more other simple polygons
subtracted from it - the holes.
The holes cannot touch or intersect with the outline of the filled
polygon.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertices - Interleaved array of (x, y) vertex coordinates for each of
the polygons, including holes.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertex_counts - Number of vertices for each polygon.
The number of vertices in the filled polygon is given by
vertex_counts[0] and must be at least three.
Subsequent elements indicate the number of vertices in each hole.
The array must be terminated with an element with value zero.
.IP \[bu] 2
color - Color of the filled polygon
.PP
When the y-axis is facing downwards (the usual) the filled polygon
coordinates must be ordered anti-clockwise.
All hole vertices must use the opposite order (clockwise with y down).
All hole vertices must be inside the main polygon and no hole may
overlap the main polygon.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
float vertices[] = {
      0,   0, // filled polygon, upper left corner
      0, 100, // filled polygon, lower left corner
    100, 100, // filled polygon, lower right corner
    100,   0, // filled polygon, upper right corner
     10,  10, // hole, upper left
     90,  10, // hole, upper right
     90,  90  // hole, lower right
};
int vertex_counts[] = {
   4, // number of vertices for filled polygon
   3, // number of vertices for hole
   0  // terminator
};
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There are 7 vertices: four for an outer square from (0, 0) to (100, 100)
in anti-clockwise order, and three more for an inner triangle in
clockwise order.
The outer main polygon uses vertices 0 to 3 (inclusive) and the hole
uses vertices 4 to 6 (inclusive).
