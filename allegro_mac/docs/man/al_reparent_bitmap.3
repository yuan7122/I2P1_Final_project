.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
For a sub-bitmap, changes the parent, position and size.
This is the same as destroying the bitmap and re-creating it with
al_create_sub_bitmap(3) - except the bitmap pointer stays the same.
This has many uses, for example an animation player could return a
single bitmap which can just be re-parented to different animation
frames without having to re-draw the contents.
Or a sprite atlas could re-arrange its sprites without having to
invalidate all existing bitmaps.
