.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Gets the flags of the display.
.PP
In addition to the flags set for the display at creation time with
al_set_new_display_flags(3) it can also have the ALLEGRO_MINIMIZED flag
set, indicating that the window is currently minimized.
This flag is very platform-dependent as even a minimized application may
still render a preview version so normally you should not care whether
it is minimized or not.
