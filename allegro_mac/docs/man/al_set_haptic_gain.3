.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

bool al_set_haptic_gain(ALLEGRO_HAPTIC *hap, double gain)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sets the gain of the haptic device if supported.
Gain is much like volume for sound, it is as if every effect\[cq]s
intensity is multiplied by it.
Gain is a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Returns true if set successfully, false if not.
Only works if al_get_haptic_capabilities(3) returns a value that has
ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_GAIN(3)ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_CONSTANTS(3) set.
If not, this function returns false, and all effects will be played
without any gain influence.

\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[R] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
