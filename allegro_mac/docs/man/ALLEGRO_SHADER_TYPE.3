ALLEGRO_SHADER_TYPE - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

typedef enum ALLEGRO_SHADER_TYPE ALLEGRO_SHADER_TYPE;
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Used with al_attach_shader_source(3) and al_attach_shader_source_file(3)
to specify how to interpret the attached source.
.TP
ALLEGRO_VERTEX_SHADER
A vertex shader is executed for each vertex it is used with.
The program will output exactly one vertex at a time.
.RS
.PP
When Allegro\[cq]s graphics are being used then in addition to all
vertices of primitives from the primitives addon, each drawn bitmap also
consists of four vertices.
.RE
.TP
ALLEGRO_PIXEL_SHADER
A pixel shader is executed for each pixel it is used with.
The program will output exactly one pixel at a time - either in the
backbuffer or in the current target bitmap.
.RS
.PP
With Allegro\[cq]s builtin graphics this means the shader is for example
called for each destination pixel of the output of an al_draw_bitmap(3)
call.
.PP
A more accurate term for pixel shader would be fragment shader since one
final pixel in the target bitmap is not necessarily composed of only a
single output but of multiple fragments (for example when multi-sampling
is being used).
