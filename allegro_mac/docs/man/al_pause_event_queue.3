\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

void al_pause_event_queue(ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE *queue, bool pause)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Pause or resume accepting new events into the event queue (to resume,
pass false for \f[C]pause\f[R]).
Events already in the queue are unaffected.
.PP
While a queue is paused, any events which would be entered into the
queue are simply ignored.
This is an alternative to unregistering then re-registering all event
sources from the event queue, if you just need to prevent events piling
up in the queue for a while.
