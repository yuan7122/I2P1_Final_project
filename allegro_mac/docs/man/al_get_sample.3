Note this returns a pointer to an internal structure, \f[I]not\f[R] the
ALLEGRO_SAMPLE(3) that you may have passed to al_set_sample(3).
However, the sample buffer of the returned ALLEGRO_SAMPLE will be the
same as the one that was used to create the sample (passed to
al_create_sample(3)).

compare it.
