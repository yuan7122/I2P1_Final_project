#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

ALLEGRO_BITMAP *al_load_bitmap_f(ALLEGRO_FILE *fp, const char *ident)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Loads an image from an ALLEGRO_FILE(3) stream into a new
ALLEGRO_BITMAP(3).
The file type is determined by the passed `ident' parameter, which is a
file name extension including the leading dot.
If (and only if) `ident' is NULL, the file type is determined with
al_identify_bitmap_f(3) instead.
.PP
This is the same as calling al_load_bitmap_flags_f(3) with 0 for the
flags parameter.
.PP
Returns NULL on error.
The file remains open afterwards.
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] the core Allegro library does not support any image file
formats by default.
You must use the allegro_image addon, or register your own format
handler.
